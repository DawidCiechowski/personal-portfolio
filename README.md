# Hey! This is my personal portoflio website codebase!

I've been playing around with few techs that I didn't work before with: Next, nodemailer, framer-motion and react-markdown. I think there's going to be a bunch more, eventually, but for now I will be providing probably regular updates to the website, until I'm fully satisfied with the look and the fill, so there will be a lot of changes.

## Blog

It will also act as my blog/article site. I'm currently working on few firsts: Polish version of Worldle in Flutter with BloC and API written with FastAPI, Docker Compose and others, some Python essentials article and few others that I don't wanna mention here yet.

> **NOTE** This part of README will be updated with links, once the articles are out!
